# Borges
> A complete re-design

This is a recreation of [Borges 1885Â´s website](http://www.borges1885.com.ar/), but with a new design and backend. It uses React for the frontend and Django + GraphQL for the API.

## What I've learned

I wanted to learn how to build a web application based upon an already existing idea/product. This is different from having to build something freely, since the essence
of the previous page cannot be lost in the way.
